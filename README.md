# Big Two Counter
#### An android app to calculate the score for a four-player big two game. Works by calculating the differences between cards left of each player after the round ends. Big Two is also known as "taiti".

Note: cater to the scoring conventions of my play. if player has more than 11 cards left, the difference is doubled. if player has 13 cards left, the difference is tripled. if a player wins with Dragon, which is 345678910JQKA2, the other players lose 13x5=65 points, and he gains 13x5x3=195 points
